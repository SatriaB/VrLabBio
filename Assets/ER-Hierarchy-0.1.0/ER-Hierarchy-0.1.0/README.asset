  Title: ER Hierarchy
  Description: "<b>How to use</b>\nEnable this tool via Menu Item -> Tools -> ER
    Hierarchy -> Enable.\n\r\n- <i>Gradient Highlight for Each Object</i>\r\nEvery
    GameObject in the Hierarchy is given a soft gradient highlight, making it easier
    to distinguish between objects and improving overall readability.\r\n\r\n- <i>Connector
    Lines Between Parent and Child Objects</i>\r\nVisual lines are drawn between
    parent and child GameObjects, clearly representing the hierarchy structure. This
    makes nested relationships more immediately visible and easier to follow.\r\n\r\n-
    <i>Component Icons Displayed Next to GameObject Names</i>\r\nIf a GameObject
    has certain components (e.g., Rigidbody, Collider, Light), an appropriate icon
    is displayed beside the object\u2019s name. This feature helps developers quickly
    identify the components attached to each object without needing to inspect them
    manually.\r\n\r\n- <i>Header Object Styling Using '---' Text</i>\r\nUsers can
    turn any GameObject into a visual section header by including the text \"---\"
    in its name. This will apply a distinct styling to the object, visually separating
    it from other items and helping organize the hierarchy into clearly defined sections.\r\n"
